Scenario: I want to compare the prices of common grocery items from three different stores (Store A, Store B, and Store C) so I can see which store offers the cheapest prices.

What the 2D Array Represents:
Rows: Each grocery item (Rice, Milk, Bread, Eggs, Apples)
Columns: Prices from different stores (Store A, Store B, Store C)

Example Data: Grocery Item Prices Table

Item	Store A	Store B	Store C
Rice	52	      50	    55
Milk	75	      72	    78
Bread	45	      48	    46
Eggs	8	        9	      8.5
Apples 12	      11	    13

(Prices in pesos per unit)

Sample Output After Running the Code:
Price of Milk in Store B: 72
Prices of Rice across all stores: [52, 50, 55]
Updating Bread price in Store B to 47.
Updated prices for Bread: [45, 47, 46]
